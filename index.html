                <p>My story starts in a little town named La Paz in Chihuahua, Mexico. When I was born, everyone from the town  came to see me, and since then I’ve believed I was destined for greatness, or at least I’m speaking it into <em>existence</em>.</p>
                <p> A few months later, I was brought to Dallas, Texas, where I’ve lived ever since. My dad worked in the U.S., and I was raised alongside my little brother. My childhood was filled with love and normalcy until I was about ten. That year, my dad went back to Mexico with my brother, and I had to stay behind with my mom. I didn’t understand why. I knew about my legal status, but I didn’t grasp what it meant until I got older especially when I realized I couldn’t pursue my dream of working for the FBI.</p>
                <p>Eventually, my dad was able to sponsor us, and by the time I was 12, both my mom and I became Permanent Residents. Fast foward many years  I went to Dallas College and earned my Associate’s degree during the peak of the COVID pandemic. Though it was a virtual graduation, it still felt like a big accomplishment. Life threw me another curve when I endured a deeply painful relationship with emotional, physical, and mental hardship that I eventually walked away from. At 26, I returned to my parents’ home and began to heal.</p>
                <p>Recently, my dad lost his job after decades of working hard for us. I can feel his stress and uncertainty, and that moment lit a fire in me. I want to do more not just for myself, but for my family. They’ve done everything for me. Now it’s <strong>my turn</strong> to step up.</p>

                <p> I never really took the time to define my identity until now. If I had to put it into words, I’d say it’s a blend of my past, the values I was taught, and the soul I carry. I am an immigrant. I am the product of love, strength, and sacrifice. I am someone who believes in doing right and helping others whenever I can.</p>
                <p>My identity is shaped by my experiences, my family, and my dreams. I am not extremely religious, but I do believe in God and the power of prayer. I am a proud Mexican-American, and I embrace both cultures.I am determined to make my mark on the world. I believe everyone has a purpose. I may not know exactly what mine is yet, but I’m working every day to find it.</p>

                <p>My journey into tech is just beginning. This is my first semester back in school, and I’m currently taking three classes. Web development is one of them, and although it’s been a challenge, I’m really enjoying it. It’s a learning curve, but I love the process of building something from nothing. </p>
                <p>I’m not just learning code I’m building a future for myself and for the people who’ve always believed in me. I don’t know exactly where this road leads, but I know I’m on the right path. And that’s enough for now.</p>
